# Overview

As a Researcher for the University of Minnesota's GopherHack group, I write and present weekly lectures on cybersecurity topics ranging from introductory concepts to specialized research areas. These sessions are used as a personal practice to:
- Rewrite technical topics with more intuition behind them
- Write my own demonstrations and workflows as if they were reports.
- Document processes and scripts for reproducibility

# Obsidian Notes

These notes were written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian is a Markdown-based text editor for note taking and organization. Many features of Markdown used in this documentation may not render properly in Github or other formats, and I recommend installing obsidian for the best experience.

# Organization

Each weekâ€™s folder breakdown:
- Random.md - Personal study notes and technical research documentation
- Script.md - Lecture scripts
- Walkthrough.md - Step-by-step exercises and environment for demo portions
- \[date].pdf - Images / Diagrams accompanying the lecture
